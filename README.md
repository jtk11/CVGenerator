# CVGenerator
Generate 10 random CV wave files using Fourier series for use in any application that accepts DC-coupled samples (eg, Assimil8or)

This script was written with the Assimil8or in mind. One of the lesser known features of the Assimil8or is that it does DC-coupled sampling, so you can sample LFOs, modulation sources, etc. Since the sample library of such things is quite small, you may want to generate some of your own.
